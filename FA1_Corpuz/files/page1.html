			<li>In a game of Zeppelins and Planes fighting each other, this one is really underrated for how good it is. It costs 6 points, 2 more than the light bomber.</li>
			<li>The plane's averagely fast, has less bullets than the light bomber but has been oufitted with 6 rockets for your disposal, which can be shot very fast.</li>
			<li>A single rocket would kill or heavily wound them. A single barrage would destroy or set an ammo box on a burning state.</li>
			<li>A good strategy for this plane is to keep resupplying and shooting rockets at ammo boxes when the enemy zeppelin is nearby</li>
			<li>As said before, a rocket can oneshot a player at close range, so it's good to shoot one at an enemy plane that's going straight for you.</li>
