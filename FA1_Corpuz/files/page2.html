			<li>Ah the Torpedo Bomber, costs 8 point, has a tailgunner, and can destroy a fuel tank 500 studs away.</li>
			<li>It's pretty good for grabbing a boarding buddy and taking out an important part.</li>
			<li>You must release the Torpedo atleast 700 studs away to be effective. It's fairly slow but your tailgunner can defend your back</li>
			<li>You should try to destroy the back fuel tank by going under the hanger and shoot through the gap and hit the fuel tank, sniping it.</li
			<li>Once a tank snipe is successful, it's time for you and your buddy to board the enemy zeppelin, plant your bombs and defend both the bombs and the spreading fire from the hanger.</li>
