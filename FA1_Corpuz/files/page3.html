			<li>It's slow, costs 14 points, which is the most in the game, has the most health out of all the planes and carries a faster gun, 2 torpedoes and a tailgunner.</li>
			<li>Like the torpedo bomber, but bigger and beefier. It's quite slow and enemy planes see it as a threat to the zeppelin.</li>
			<li>It's probably for the best to keep this in the back lines and act as airborne artillery, it can also be used to send your tailgunner down the enemy zeppelin to serve as a temporary distraction.</li>
