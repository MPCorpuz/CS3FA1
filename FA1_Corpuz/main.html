		<p>Click the images to learn about these planes in a game you've never heard of.
		<br>The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy team's zeppelin while keeping yours in good condition. You're given a choice of two roles:
		<br>Crew member: In charge of repairing Ammo Boxes and Fuel tanks, shooting cannons to damage the Zeppelin, extinguishing fires, defusing bombs, Exterminating boarders and nearby enemy planes. 
			<br>We'll be discussing about this role in a later date.
			<br>Pilot: Their loadouts include a pistol, melee weapon, and a bomb. Their mission is to board the enemy ship, plant a bomb, and defend it until it goes off
			<br>Pilots can fly planes by spending points at a spawner located at the back of the Zeppelin. Light bombers, Rocket Planes, and Fighter Planes can be bought and spawned at the hanger.
			<br>While Torpedo Bombers and Heavy Bombers can be spawned at the runway. It contains fire extinguishers and torpedo resupply and can repair and resupply allied planes landed on it.
			<br>In order to be a good pilot, you must try and shoot down atleast a plane and then drop down the on the enemy ship in which you'll plant a bomb on important parts of the zeppelin.
